Hello hungry Hackers, we are ordering from {{ .provider }}. You can take part in
the order by typing:

.{{ .provider }} add <item-id>
.{{ .provider }} remove <item-id>

If you got your item id wrong, you could also just react with 'ðŸ“‰' to the order
message or delete it. You can also order the same as someone else by reacting
with 'ðŸ“ˆ'. I will react with 'âœ…' when I got your request.
